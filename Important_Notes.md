**There is a small issue with SVM\_LIGHT. The packaged model was created with verion 6.02. If your version of SVM\_CLASSIFY is other than 6.02, you should try changing the first line of model\_svm/svm\_model (automatically created by SVM\_LEARN) to match your version. If that doesn't work, please let me know.**
